# Polaris's Portfolio

This is a little website I made to host my projects and high scores for games
I've made. Future projects will likely be making use of the high scores API.

Features include HTML5/CSS/JS styling and animations, a JSON-yielding high
scores API, with which my games interact, and content served from Amazon's S3
CDN.
